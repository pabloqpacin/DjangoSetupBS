# DjangoSetupBS 

Automate the creation of a Django project with the script [DjangoSetup.sh](/scripts/DjangoSetup.sh).

If preferred, download the package [DjangoSetupBS.7z](/package/OhMyDjango.7z).

Please note:

- [Documentation](/docs/documentation.md) and [instructions](/docs/instructions.md) available!
- We recommend running the `script` command beforehand (see [man-page](/docs/manScript.txt)) <!-- - We couldn't include such command-instruction in our script^[documentation] since it would start a subshell and thus our script won't run (as there will be no INPUT from the user to the `read` command)^[if only we could delete such `read`....]   -->
- You may change the <django_project> and <first_webapp> names within the Bash script üïµÔ∏è
- Follow [keySetup.md](/docs/keySetup.md) checklist ‚Äî before commiting any files to Git version-control!
